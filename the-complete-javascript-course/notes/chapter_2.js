//break down the code into functionalities, then invoke them in an order that makes sense and when necessary

// constant variable means the outcome will never change
// let variable means the value of it is likely to change, especially when changing the definitions of the key

let sentence ="hello world" // this is a string of characters, ya know, to make words and such

null //means the intentional absence of an object's value

undefined //absence of a value in which the value has not been determined

// boolean // a variable that can have a value of true or false

// arrays use the square brackets
// if using numbers, they have to be separated by commas 
// this is a storage of information

// these are numerical operators... yay mathÂ ðŸ˜…
// = means something... well... equals something
// + means addition 
// - means subtraction 
// * is multiplications
//  / is division
// % is modulous, another word for remainder, or what is left over

// these are comparison operators
// == asks if the first value is equal to the second in the function
// === this is more strict, they have to be the same, so no mixing script with numbers
// != the opposite of the first two


// functions helps group different related bodies of logic
// multiplyTwoNumbers (3, 5)
// multiplyTwoNumbers ('6', 6)
// multiplyTwoNumbers (7, 5)

// these are logical operators
// && means both condition 1 AND 2 are true
// || means either contition 1 OR 2 is true
// ! means neither condition 1 or 2 are true
// ! isn't used between conditions like the others, it assigns a single condition to be not true
